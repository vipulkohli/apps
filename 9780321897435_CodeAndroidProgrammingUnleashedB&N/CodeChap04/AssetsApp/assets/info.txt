Besides the res/ directory that contains the resources of the application, Android provides one more directory assets/ directory for keeping assets. The difference between resources and assets is that the resources i.e. the content stored in the res/ directory is accessible in an Android application through the resource IDs. Recall, Android automatically generates an R.java which contains IDs of the resources found in res/ folder making it possible to access them through Java code.Whereas, the content placed in the assets/ directory is maintained as raw file format. To read the content from the assets/ folder in an Android applicaton, we make use of the  AssetManager that reads the content from the external files kept in the assets/ folder in the form of a stream of bytes.
